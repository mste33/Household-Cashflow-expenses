/*  The class called Fund has attributes for different types of cash,
 *  such as loonies and toonies etc. The class has several methods, 
 *  including constructors, accessor and mutator methods, 
 *  a method for adding funds, a method for calculating the total value of the funds, 
 *  a method for formatting the fund information as a string, 
 *  and a method for comparing two Fund objects for equality.
